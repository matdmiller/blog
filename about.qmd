Hi, my name is Mat Miller. I work on technology in the engineering and construction sector in the North America. My degree is in engineering and I am a self-taught coder. The purpose of this blog is to document my journey learning AI through the [fast.ai](https://fast.ai) course and to discuss other technology projects I find interesting.
